### .

Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is **Dragos** and I'm a **student of Artificial Intelligence** at the University of Florence. Despite having a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, my passion for technology and computer science has always been a driving force in my life. In my free time, I love to explore the latest technologies and work on personal projects to hone my skills.

Currently, I am working as a **software engineer at Firenze Race Team**, where I specialize in developing advanced **trajectory estimation algorithms**. My work allows me to blend my interests in engineering, technology, and sports, as I use cutting-edge software and analytical techniques to help race teams achieve optimal performance.

On this page, you'll find a collection of my personal projects and code samples that showcase my skills in programming, data analysis, and software development. I'm always eager to collaborate with other developers and learn new things, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together!
